## Notes

1. **Handoff Activities:** Some activities trigger handoffs to other modules (marked with *Handoff to...*)
2. **Scope Policy:** Activities marked with *(Handoff)* have `scopePolicy: 'NONE'`
3. **Units:** Commissioning activities are tracked in "Units" rather than traditional measurements
4. **Grid Tracking:** All activities can be tracked down to PV Area > Block > Row > Column level for precise progress monitoring
